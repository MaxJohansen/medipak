# Medpack

Medpack is a student project working to create an IoT-device using the LoRaWAN network.

## Getting started

### Visual Studio extensions

* pymakr (however, this usually never works when you need it to)

### Better alternatives to pymakr

* [mpfshell](https://github.com/wendlers/mpfshell)
