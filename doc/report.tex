\section*{Problem}
In medical emergencies the process of triage is made necessary because there are often more wounded than there are personnel to take care of them. But the condition of patients who are considered lower priority could change unexpectedly which could lead to unfortunate outcomes. In a hospital these patients could be hooked up to monitoring equipment, but in the field we do not have the infrastructure required for this.

\section*{Solution}
We propose a portable device with an array of sensors that can quickly be attached to patients in the field to monitor their health. This device would measure things like skin temperature, motion and heart rate and track them over time. The device would transmit this data to a central dashboard that could alert medical personnel of any sudden changes like a drop in temperature, a change in motion patterns or an irregular heartbeat.
